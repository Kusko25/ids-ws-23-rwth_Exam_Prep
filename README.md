I used these notebooks to work through the first practice exam, mainly to aid understanding and check my answers.  
I recommend not running the cells before you tried to solve the task with paper and calculator first, but I'm not your mother so do as you please.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of my solutions and in fact if you think I'm wrong please let me know.  
The repository contains none of the actual exam material so if you are from the uni I'm pretty sure this is legal
